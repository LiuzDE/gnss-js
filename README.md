# GNSS.js

GNSS.js is a library for all JavaScript environments (browser, Node.js, etc.) to perform several types of GNSS-related computations.

The name GNSS.js is dervived from the acronym GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) and JS (JavaScript).

There are multiple conversion functions between different time and coordinate systems, such as `getRINEX`, `getDateFromRINEX`, etc.

Further documentation will follow in the future.
